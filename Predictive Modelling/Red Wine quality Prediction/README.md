# Red-wine-Quality-prediction
Wine certification includes physiochemical tests like determination of density, pH, alcohol quantity, fixed and volatile acidity etc. We have a large datasets having the physiochemical tests results and quality on the scale of 1 to 10 of wines of the Vinho Verde variety.Such a model can be used not only by the certification bodies but also by the wine producers to improve quality based on the physicochemical properties and by the consumers to predict the quality of wines.
